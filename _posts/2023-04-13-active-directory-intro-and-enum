# Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration

Active Directory Domain Services is a service that allows system administrators to update and manage operating systems, applications, users, and data access on a large scale.

## Active Directory - Introduction

All ADs have a domain name, like "corp.com", for which "corp" is often the org's name. AD relies on the DNS service and a typical domain contrller (DC) will also host a DNS server that is authoritative for the domain.

The objects (users, groups, and computers) are often organized into Organizational Units (OUs), which are comparable to file system folders.

AD relies on many things, like how user login requests are sent to the DC which checks whether or not that user is allowed to log in to that domain. One or more DCs act as the hub and core of the domain.

Members of Domain Admin are the most privileged objects in the domain, and compromising this member gives complete control over the domain.

AD instances can host more than one domain in a domain tree or multiple domain trees in a domain forest. There are Domain Admins for each domain in the forest, and there is an Enterprise Admin that has full control over all domains in the forest and has Admin privs over all DCs.

We will leverage a variety of tools to manually enumerate AD, most of which rely on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

### Enumeration - Defining Our Goals

In this case, we are investigating corp.com under the assumed breach of stephanie, who has RDP perms on Win11. We will perform the enumeration from one client machine with the low privileged stephanie domain user.

Once we gain access to additional users or computers, we will have to repeat parts of enum. This is the "pivot", and each one may give opportunitiy to advance our attack. 

## Active Directory - Manual Enumeration

```

RDP to stephanie's client.

```console
$ xfreerdp /u:stephanie /d:corp.com /v:192.168.154.75

```

On her desktop, use cmd.

```console

### Enumerating Active Directory using PowerShell and .NET Classes

PowerShell cmdlets like Get-ADUser1 work well but they are only installed by default on domain controllers as part of the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT), which is rarely present on clients and we would need admin privs to install.

We could, in principle, import the DLL required for enum, but we won't cover that here.

When a domain machine searches for an object, like a printer, or when we query user or group objects, LDAP is used as the communication channel for the query.

We need a specific LDAP ADsPath in order to communicate with the AD service.

```
LDAP://HostName[:PortNumber][/DistinguishedName]
```

Host name can be a computer name, IP, or domain naim. Note that if there are multiple DCs, setting the domain name could resolve to any of the DCs IP addresses. We should use the IP of the DC with the most updated info, called the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).  The port number is optional. It will automatically choose the port based on whether or not we are using an SSL connection. However, it is worth noting that if we come across a domain in the future using non-default ports, we may need to manually add this to the script.

Let's write the script, .\enumeration.ps1.

```
# Store the domain object in the $domainObj variable
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()

# Store the PdcRoleOwner name to the $PDC variable
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name

# Store the Distinguished Name variable into the $DN variable
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName

$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"
$LDAP
```

```console
PS> powershell -ep bypass

PS>  .\enumeration.ps1
LDAP://DC1.corp.com/DC=corp,DC=com
```

Now, we have the full LDAP path required for enum.

### Adding Search Functionality to our Script

```
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"

$direntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($LDAP)

$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.FindAll()
```

One thing to note with DirectoryEntry is that we can pass it credentials to authenticate to the domain. However, since we are already logged in, there is no need to do that here.

Running the above script will produce a lot of output. We can filer using samAccountType and other methods.

The official documentation reveals different values of the samAccountType attribute, but we'll start with 0x30000000 (decimal 805306368), which will enumerate all users in the domain.

We will also add an interation through each object to print each property on its own line.

```
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"

$direntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($LDAP)

$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.filter="samAccountType=805306368"
$result = $dirsearcher.FindAll()

Foreach($obj in $result)
{
    Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
    {
        $prop
    }

    Write-Host "-------------------------------"
}
```

This complete script will search through AD and filter the results based on the samAccountType of our choosing.

We can filter based on any property of any object type. For example, we can change the script to filter for name=jeffadmin and added .memberof to the $prop variable to only display the groups jeffadmin is a member of.

```
$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.filter="name=jeffadmin"
$result = $dirsearcher.FindAll()

Foreach($obj in $result)
{
    Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
    {
        $prop.memberof
    }

    Write-Host "-------------------------------"
}
```

We can make the script more flexible, allowing us to add the required parameters via the command line. For example, we could have the script accept the samAccountType we wish to enumerate as a command line argument.

```
function LDAPSearch {
    param (
        [string]$LDAPQuery
    )

    $PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
    $DistinguishedName = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName

    $DirectoryEntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://$PDC/$DistinguishedName")

    $DirectorySearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($DirectoryEntry, $LDAPQuery)

    return $DirectorySearcher.FindAll()

}
```

To use this, you will need to do the following:

```console
PS> Import-Module .\function.ps1
PS> LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(samAccountType=805306368)"
```

We can also search directly for an Object Class, which is a component of AD that defines the object type. Let's use objectClass=group in this case to list all the groups in the domain:

```console
PS> LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(objectclass=group)"
LDAP://DC1.corp.com/CN=Read-only Domain Controllers,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com            {usnchanged, distinguishedname, grouptype, whencreated...}
LDAP://DC1.corp.com/CN=Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com {iscriticalsystemobject, usnchanged, distinguishedname, grouptype...}
...
```

This script enumerates more tha net.exe! This is because it enumerates all AD objects including Domain Local groups (not just global groups).

We can also call this in the cmd line such that we can print properties and attributes for objects.

```console
PS> foreach ($group in $(LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(objectCategory=group)")){ $group.properties | select {$_.cn}, {$_.member} }
```

Earlier when we enumerated the Sales Department group with net.exe, we only found two users in it: pete and stephanie. In this case however, it appears that Development Department is also a member.

For easier to read output, pipe the output into a variable and print the attribute of the variable.

```console
PS> $sales = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Sales Department))"
PS> $sales.properties.member
```

This group within a group is known as a nested group, which are common. net.exe missed this because it only lists user objects, not group objects. net.exe also cannot display specific attributes. 

Let's enum the Development Department more.

```console
PS> $group = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Development Department*))"

PS> $group.properties.member
CN=Management Department,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=dave,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

Another nested group - Management Department is a member of Development Department. 

```console
PS> $group = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Management Department*))"
PS> $group.properties.member
CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

We found the end! Note that jen is a member of Management Department, but also an indirect member of Sales Department and Development Department. This is normal for AD, but, if misconfigured, users might end up with more privileges than they should.

## AD Enumeration with PowerView

PowerView is a popular PS script for enum.

```console
PS> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1

PS> Get-NetDomain
Forest                  : corp.com
DomainControllers       : {DC1.corp.com}
Children                : {}
DomainMode              : Unknown
DomainModeLevel         : 7
Parent                  :
PdcRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
RidRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
InfrastructureRoleOwner : DC1.corp.com
Name                    : corp.com

PS> Get-NetUser

// too much output

NOTE that passwords set a long time ago may be weaker than the current policy, making them easier to crack.

```console
PS> Get-NetUser | select cn,pwdlastset,lastlogon

## Manual Enumeration - Expanding our Repertoire

### Enumerating Operating Systems

```console
PS> Get-NetComputer
// lots of output

// many attribures are interesting, use select to get them

PS> Get-NetComputer | select operatingsystem,dnshostname
operatingsystem              dnshostname
---------------              -----------
Windows Server 2022 Standard DC1.corp.com
Windows Server 2022 Standard web04.corp.com
Windows Server 2022 Standard FILES04.corp.com
Windows 11 Pro               client74.corp.com
Windows 11 Pro               client75.corp.com
Windows 10 Pro               CLIENT76.corp.com
```

### Getting an Overview - Permissions and Logged on Users

When a user logs in to the domain, their credentials are cached in memory on the computer they logged in from. If we can steal those creds, we may be able to use them to authenticate as the domain user and potentially escalate domain privileges.

During an AD assessment, though, we may not always want to escalate our privileges right away. We should try to maintain our access, and if we can compromise other users that have the same perms as the user we currently have access to, this allows us to maintain our foothold. 

In order to find possible attack paths, we'll need to learn more about our initial user and see what else we have access to in the domain. We also need to find out where other users are logged in. 

PowerView's Find-LocalAdminAccess command scans the network in an attempt to determine if our current user has administrative permissions on any computers in the domain.

```console
PS> Find-LocalAdminAccess
client74.corp.com
```

Stephanie has Local admin on Client 74. Pause! Do not immediately log in to CLIENT74 to check perms. Zoom out.

Find currently logged in users.

```console
PS> Get-NetSession -ComputerName files04 -Verbose
VERBOSE: [Get-NetSession] Error: Access is denied

PS> Get-NetSession -ComputerName web04 -Verbose
VERBOSE: [Get-NetSession] Error: Access is denied
```

Priv issues... Run it as stephanie against the machine she has local admin on.

```console
PS> Get-NetSession -ComputerName client74 -Verbose
CName        : \\192.168.154.75
UserName     : stephanie
Time         : 0
IdleTime     : 0
ComputerName : client74
```

The permissions required to enumerate sessions with NetSessionEnum are defined in the SrvsvcSessionInfo registry key, which is located in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity hive.

```console
PS> Get-Acl -Path HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity\ | fl

Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Defaul

```

Let's look at the OS versions in use.

```console
PS> Get-NetComputer | select dnshostname,operatingsystem,operatingsystemversion
dnshostname       operatingsystem              operatingsystemversion
-----------       ---------------              ----------------------
DC1.corp.com      Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
web04.corp.com    Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
FILES04.corp.com  Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
client74.corp.com Windows 11 Enterprise        10.0 (22000)
client75.corp.com Windows 11 Enterprise        10.0 (22000)
CLIENT76.corp.com Windows 10 Pro               10.0 (16299)
```

Because of this, we will not be able to use PowerView to build the domain map we had in mind on systems since Windows Server 2019 build 1809.

There are more tools we can use if we run into this.

```console
PS> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\files04
PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on
Copyright (C) 2000-2016 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

Users logged on locally:
     <unknown time>             CORP\jeff
Unable to query resource logons

PS> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\web04

PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on
Copyright (C) 2000-2016 Mark Russinovich

No one is logged on locally.
Unable to query resource logons

PS> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\client74
PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on

Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

Users logged on locally:
     <unknown time>             CORP\jeffadmin

Users logged on via resource shares:
     4/13/2024 3:14:54 PM       CORP\stephanie
```

If our enumeration is accurate and we in fact have administrative privileges on CLIENT74, we should be able to log in there and possibly steal jeffadmin's credentials!

### Enumeration Through Service Principal Names

Service Accounts may also be members of high-privileged groups. Applications must be executed in the context of an operating system user. If a user launches an application, that user account defines the context. However, services launched by the system itself run in the context of a Service Account.

Isolated applications can use a set of predefined service accounts, such as LocalSystem, LocalService, and NetworkService. For more complex applications, a domain user account may be used to provide the needed context while still maintaining access to resources inside the domain.

When applications like Exchange, MS SQL, or Internet Information Services (IIS) are integrated into AD, a unique service instance identifier known as Service Principal Name (SPN) associates a service to a specific service account in Active Directory.

Let's enumerate Service Principal Names (SPNs).

```console
PS> setspn -L iis_service
Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=iis_service,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com:
        HTTP/web04.corp.com
        HTTP/web04
        HTTP/web04.corp.com:80

PS> Get-NetUser -SPN | select samaccountname,serviceprincipalname
samaccountname serviceprincipalname
-------------- --------------------
krbtgt         kadmin/changepw
iis_service    {HTTP/web04.corp.com, HTTP/web04, HTTP/web04.corp.com:80}

PS> nslookup.exe web04.corp.com
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  192.168.154.70

Name:    web04.corp.com
Address:  192.168.154.72
```

We see that this hostname is resolving to an internal IP. Navigating to the IP results in a webset with a login requirement.

In this case, we will note and remember that the IIS service has a linked SPN, which might run with more privielges than regular domain user accounts.

### Enumerating Object Permissions

These are the permission types used to configure Access Control Entries (ACEs) that we are interested in:

```
GenericAll: Full permissions on object
GenericWrite: Edit certain attributes on the object
WriteOwner: Change ownership of the object
WriteDACL: Edit ACE's applied to object
AllExtendedRights: Change password, reset password, etc.
ForceChangePassword: Password change for object
Self (Self-Membership): Add ourselves to for example a group
```

Let's enumerate ACEs.

```console
PS> Get-ObjectAcl -Identity stephanie
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ReadProperty
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-553

// there is a lot of output, but the above is what we are interested in

// let's look at the SIDs

PS> Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104
CORP\stephanie

PS> Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-553
CORP\RAS and IAS Servers
```

Taking this information together, the RAS and IAS Servers group has ReadProperty access rights to our user. While this is a common configuration in AD and likely won't give us an attack vector, we have used the example to make sense of the information we have obtained.

In short, we are interested in the ActiveDirectoryRights and SecurityIdentifier for each object we enumerate going forward.

The highest access permission we can have on an object is GenericAll

```console
PS> Get-ObjectAcl -Identity "Management Department" | ? {$_.ActiveDirectoryRights -eq "GenericAll"} | select SecurityIdentifier,ActiveDirectoryRights

SecurityIdentifier                            ActiveDirectoryRights
------------------                            ---------------------
S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-512             GenericAll
S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104            GenericAll

It is not common for Users like stephanie to have the GenericAll permission. This may be a misconfiguration we can exploit.

As an experiment to show the power of misconfigured object permissions, let's try to use our permissions as stephanie to add ourselves to this group with net.exe.

```console
PS> net group "Management Department" stephanie /add /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

The command completed successfully.

PS> Get-NetGroup "Management Department" | select member
member
------
{CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com}

// cleanup

PS> net group "Management Department" stephanie /del /domain

PS> Get-NetGroup "Management Department" | select member
member
------
CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

We found a password! Historically, system administrators often changed local workstation passwords through Group Policy Preferences (GPP). However, even though GPP-stored passwords are encrypted with AES-256, the private key for the encryption has been posted on MSDN. can use this key to decrypt these encrypted passwords.

```console
kali$ gpp-decrypt "+bsY0V3d4/KgX3VJdO/vyepPfAN1zMFTiQDApgR92JE"
P@$$w0rd
```

Note this password down. Let's look at other shares of interest.

Hi Jeff,

We are excited to have you on the team here in Corp. As Pete mentioned, we have been without a system administrator
since Dennis left, and we are very happy to have you on board.

Pete mentioned that you had some issues logging in to your Corp account, so I'm sending this email to you on your personal address.

The username I'm sure you already know, but here you have the brand new auto generated password as well: HenchmanPutridBonbon11

As you may be aware, we are taking security more seriously now after the previous breach, so please change the password at first login.

Best Regards
Stephanie

Hey Stephanie,

Thank you for the warm welcome. I heard about the previous breach and that Dennis left the company.

Fortunately he gave me a great deal of documentation to go through, although in paper format. I'm in the
process of digitalizing the documentation so we can all share the knowledge. For now, you can find it in
the shared folder on the file server.

Thank you for reminding me to change the password, I will do so at the earliest convenience.

Best regards
Jeff
